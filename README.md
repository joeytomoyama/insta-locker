# insta-locker

Made for insta-locking a specified hero in Overwatch 2. Currently only support heroes work.

Program runs idle in the background until activated. Program will deactivate itself when your hero has been insta-locked or after 30 seconds of not detecting a hero selection screen.

Currently only 1080p screens are supported. Changing the in-game settings related to brightness might break the functionality.
