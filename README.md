# insta-locker

Made for insta-locking a specified hero in Overwatch 2.

Program runs idle in the background until activated using specified key press. Program will deactivate itself when your hero has been insta-locked or after 15 seconds of not detecting your current hero.

Target hero and activation key can be set in the settings.json file.

Currently only 1080p screens are supported and the program is limited to support heroes. Changing the in-game settings related to brightness might break the functionality.
